A simple example in BBC Basic to:

open UART port

send UART data

close UART port

Run the basic program.
Typing keys will send that ascii out the serial uart.
Hit ENTER to exit

In this example, I use the UART of Agon attached to a serial USB device plugged into my computer

Agon        PC

Tx    <->   Rx

Rx    <->   Tx
