What is better than one MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 running SNAIL for Gopher access on the
internet?  A second MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 loaded with a Hayes Modem Emulator for
calling Telnet BBS systems over the Internet.   

WARNING!  This will probably void your warranty on your $3.76 (digikey) part. 
Also once you do this, the device will not work with SNAIL Gopher browser, 
so do this with a second device.

Here’s what you’ll need 
to replace the flash on the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 with a Hayes emulator.

o Arduino IDE
  Configure the Arduino IDE board manager for ESP8266 on the proper serial port.
  Load the ESP8266 libraries.

o A copy of PUTTY terminal

o David Hansel’s Hayes modem emulator for the ESP8266
  https://github.com/dhansel/WifiModem

o A TTL-to-USB serial device
  Make sure it can provide 3v for the ESP8266.  
  (Many of these devices supply both 5v and 3v.)

o Four hookup wires to connect the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 to the TTL-to-USB device.

o The “How to update firmware” guide for MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 hookup diagram.

Step 1.

Using the hookup guide, connect four wires from the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266
to the TTL-to-USB device.  You will need TX---RX, RX---TX, 3v, GND.

Launch a copy of putty set at 115200 and see if you can communicate with the
current firmware.  You should be able to see AT command echoed back.
Without a linefeed, you won’t get an OK response, but you will see the text 
echo to the screen, if so you are on track.

Step 2.

Load the WifiModem.ino into the Arduino IDE.  Make sure you have the board
manager configured for  Generic 8266 and the libraries for ESP8266 loaded.
Start by trying to simply compiling the code before loading it to the board.
If it compiles correctly, send it to the board.

Once you see the code load onto the board successfully, relaunch PUTTY and
configure it for 9600 baud.  Follow the instructions that repeat over and over
to press C, then configure your WIFI settings.

Congrats!  You now have a Hayes Modem emulator for your AgonLight!

Connect the device to your Agon and load a terminal program set at 9600.  
Type ATDT BBS.FOZZTEXX.COM

Enjoy!
