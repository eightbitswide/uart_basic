What is better than one MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 running SNAIL for Gopher access on the
internet?  A second MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 loaded with a Hayes Modem Emulator for
calling Telnet BBS systems over the Internet.   

WARNING!  This will probably void your warranty on your $3.76 (digikey) part. 
Also once you do this, the device will not work with SNAIL Gopher browser, 
so do this with a second device.

Here is what you will need 
to replace the flash on the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 with a Hayes emulator.

o Arduino IDE
  Configure the Arduino IDE board manager for ESP8266 on the proper serial port.
  Load the ESP8266 libraries.
  Set the board type for Olimex MOD-WIFI-ESP8266

o A copy of PUTTY terminal

o Zimodem Modem Emulator by Bo Zimmerman
  https://github.com/bozimmerman/Zimodem/tree/master

o A TTL-to-USB serial device
  Make sure it can provide 3v for the ESP8266.  
  (Many of these devices supply both 5v and 3v.)

o Four hookup wires to connect the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 to the TTL-to-USB device.

o The HOW TO UPGRADE FIRMWARE guide for MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 hookup diagram.

Step 1.

Using the hookup guide, connect four wires from the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266
to the TTL-to-USB device.  You will need TX---RX, RX---TX, 3v, GND.

Launch a copy of putty set at 115200 and see if you can communicate with the
current firmware.  You should be able to see AT command echoed back.
Without a linefeed, you will not get an OK response, but you will see the text 
echo to the screen, if so you are on track.

Step 2.

Load the zimodem.ino into the Arduino IDE.  Make sure you have the board
manager configured for Olimex MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 and the libraries for ESP8266.
Start by trying to simply compiling the code before loading it to the board.
If it compiles correctly, send it to the board.

o You'll have to hold the button in on the MOD-WIFI-ESP8266 and replug the
  device into the computer while holding the button.  Continue to hold
  the button until the actual programming starts with the Arduino IDE.

Once you see the code load onto the board successfully, relaunch PUTTY and
configure it for 1200 baud.  Type AT+CONFIG to setup Wifi and other settings.

Yes, you can change the baud rate.   The serial terminal works well at 9600.
With the baud rate connected at 1200 baud with Putty, issue a ATB9600,
then reconnect with putty @ 9600 baud.  If ATI works, type AT&W to write
the new settings to the ESP8266's flash.

Move it to your Agon and load the BASIC terminal with 9600 baud settings.

Congrats!  You now have a Hayes Modem emulator for your AgonLight!

Connect the device to your Agon and load a terminal program set at 9600.  
Type ATDT BBS.FOZZTEXX.COM

Note: Don't use AT&U6502 to update your device over the internet.
It will downgrade the unit from 4.0.1 to 3.7.

Enjoy!
